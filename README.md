Step 1:

1. Add LR Scheduler
2. Results:
  1. Parameters: 6,832
  2. Best Train Accuracy: 98.18
  3. Best Test Accuracy: 98.57 (11th Epoch), 98.50 (14th Epoch)
3. Analysis:
  1. Finding a good LR schedule is hard. We have tried to make it effective by reducing LR by the 10th after the 6th epoch.
  2. It did help in getting to 99.4 or faster, but the final accuracy is not more than 98.57. Possibly a good scheduler can do wonders here!


Step 2:

1. Add LR Scheduler
2. Results:
  1. Parameters: 13.8k
  2. Best Train Accuracy: 98.18
  3. Best Test Accuracy: 98.57 (11th Epoch), 98.50 (14th Epoch)
